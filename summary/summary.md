### Build log summary <a style="float:right; font-size: 14px;" href="#top">Scroll to top</a><a id="build-log-summary"></a>

Amazon Q successfully built the upgraded code in Java 17. Here is a relevant snippet from the build log. To view the full build log, open [`buildCommandOutput.log`](./buildCommandOutput.log)

```
The build process completed successfully. All phases, including cleaning, compiling, and testing, were executed without errors. The entire process took less than 2 seconds to complete.

### Q Generated Summary and Recommendations <a style="float:right; font-size: 14px;" href="#top">Scroll to top</a><a id="q-generated-summary-and-recommendations"></a>


 #### Summary
 Q has made the following changes during the transformation process. Please note that the summary is generated by GenAI.
1. **Text Block Usage**: In the `UserDAOImpl.java` file, the SQL statement for creating the `users` table has been refactored to use a text block ("""..."""). This change improves code readability and maintainability by allowing multi-line string literals without explicit line breaks or concatenation. The new syntax is a feature introduced in Java 15, which is now available in Java 17.
2. **POM File Formatting**: The `pom.xml` file has been reformatted, condensing the XML namespace declarations into a single line. This change is purely cosmetic and does not affect the project's functionality but improves the file's readability.
3. **Java Compiler Version Update**: The `maven.compiler.source` and `maven.compiler.target` properties in the `pom.xml` file have been updated from `1.8` to `17`. Additionally, a new property `maven.compiler.release` set to `17` has been added. These changes ensure that the project is compiled and run using Java 17 features and APIs.
4. **Maven Compiler Plugin Configuration**: The `maven-compiler-plugin` configuration in the `pom.xml` file has been updated to use the `<release>17</release>` tag instead of separate `<source>` and `<target>` tags. This change simplifies the configuration and ensures consistent use of Java 17 features across compilation and runtime.
5. **JUnit Dependency Update**: The project has switched from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5 (Jupiter). The `junit:junit:4.13.2` dependency has been replaced with `org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.12.2`. This update allows the use of newer testing features and annotations provided by JUnit 5.
6. **Test Class Updates**: In the `UserDAOImplTest.java` file, JUnit 4 imports and annotations have been replaced with their JUnit 5 counterparts. Specifically, `org.junit.Before` has been changed to `org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach`, and `org.junit.Test` to `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test`. The static imports for assertions have also been updated to use `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions`.
7. **H2 Database Dependency**: The H2 database dependency (`com.h2database:h2:2.1.214`) has been retained in the `pom.xml` file without any version change. This indicates that the existing version is compatible with Java 17 and no upgrade was necessary for this project's requirements.
8. **Project Encoding**: The `project.build.sourceEncoding` property in the `pom.xml` file has been kept as `UTF-8`. This ensures consistent character encoding across different environments and prevents potential issues with special characters in the source code.
9. **Build Plugin Version**: The `maven-compiler-plugin` version `3.8.1` has been retained in the `pom.xml` file. This version is compatible with Java 17 and supports the new `<release>` configuration, indicating that no plugin upgrade was necessary for the Java 17 migration.
10. **Test Method Annotations**: In the `UserDAOImplTest.java` file, the `@Before` annotation has been replaced with `@BeforeEach`. This change aligns with JUnit 5's naming conventions and lifecycle management, allowing for more flexible test setups.

 #### Recommendations
 Q was able to compile the upgraded app successfully. Here are detailed recommendations to further improve the upgrade. Please note that these recommendations are generated by GenAI, apply them accordingly.
1. Please review and accept the code changes using the diff viewer. If you are using a Private Repository, please ensure that updated dependencies are available.
2. If this project uses `Maven CheckStyle`, `Enforcer`, `FindBugs` or `SpotBugs plugins`, Q disabled these plugins when building the project to verify proposed upgrades. Please enable them and verify the code again.

3. To help transform the rest of your code, you can use Amazon Q chat in the IDE. You can ask Amazon Q to review the partially updated files and provide new code to address issues, such as compilation errors. You can also use features like `/dev` and `@workspace` to include more of your project as context and get suggestions for multiple files at a time.



### Planned dependencies replaced <a style="float:right; font-size: 14px;" href="#top">Scroll to top</a><a id="planned-dependencies-replaced"></a>
